# Portfolio

The current project is my portfolio, it was created using HTML and CSS.

It has responsive design and reorganizes the sections for screens with less than 900px, the project uses pseudo-classes too, it links to my github profile and when you do click over the elements from the nav it takes you to that clicked section.

It was developed using github as version control manager and i made new branches to add every new feature (the features were: responsive design and hover) and finally i merged those features to the main branch.
